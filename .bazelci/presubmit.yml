# We exclude docs/ from build_targets. Since we can't blacklist specific target
# patterns (bazelbuild/continuous-integration#779), we have to explicitly
# list every other top-level package in build_targets.
# TODO(#144): When Bazel 0.29 is released, the docgen workflow will work, and
# we can go back to using `...` for build_targets.
